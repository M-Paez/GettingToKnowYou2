<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
    Hi everyone my name is Molly Paez. I&rsquo;m currently a senior at Lewis University that is studying Computer Science and Math. 
    At home I have both my mom and dad as well as an older brother. Growing up I always had a dog my first dog was named Olive because my father
    loves olives and she had a magnificant black coat. Then we got our Clover B Dover who had a rottweiler face and a little bit later we decided to get 
    another puppy who we named Ripley after the Alien series. Ripley has a nice curled up tail and loved Clover's personal space.
